### 3. Look at the results and make observations. What would happen if we further increase k?
By increasing k, we can see no change in result. And that is because of the precision of our function.
According to the equation, we can see that the range of the answer is from 0 to 1. And we are reducing the precision to two digits. This means two digits after decimal point is not sufficient for this equation.
### 4. Now assume we have to compute all f (o 1 , . . . , o n ) for increasing n. How efficient will your program allow this to be done?
As mentioned the program will return the same answers which are not useful. We are actually limiting the abilities of the double data type, so we lose data.
